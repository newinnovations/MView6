## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

#### Windows

1. Download the latest `.msi` installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/newinnovations/MView6/releases)
2. Run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file

**Important:** The Windows installer is currently unsigned. You may see a security warning when running the installer.
This is expected and safe, the code is compiled and the installer is automatically created by Github using Github Actions.
The warning appears because we haven't purchased a code signing certificate.
To proceed:

- If you see "Windows protected your PC", click **More info** then **Run anyway**
- Some antivirus software may flag unsigned executables - this is a false positive

#### Ubuntu/Debian

1. Download the latest `.deb` package from the [releases page](https://github.com/newinnovations/MView6/releases)
2. Install using your package manager:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i mview6_*.deb
   sudo apt-get install -f  # Install any missing dependencies
   ```

Alternatively, you can double-click the `.deb` file to install through your desktop environment's package installer.

### Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- GTK4 development libraries
- Additional system dependencies may be required

#### Build and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newinnovations/MView6.git
cd MView6
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

The binary will be installed to `~/.cargo/bin/mview6` (ensure this directory is in your PATH).

### System Requirements

- **Windows:** Windows 10 or later
- **Linux:** GTK4 support (most modern distributions)
- **Memory:** 512MB RAM minimum, 2GB recommended for large documents
- **Storage:** 50MB for installation

### Troubleshooting

#### Windows

- If the installer fails to run, try running as administrator
- Some antivirus software may quarantine the installer - add an exception if needed

#### Linux

- If you encounter missing dependencies after installing the `.deb` package, run `sudo apt-get install -f`
- For other distributions, you may need to build from source

#### General

- Ensure your system has adequate graphics drivers for optimal performance
- For issues with specific file formats, check that you have the latest version installed
